## Type Inference 
Type Inference, When you declare a variable without telling the variable type, It will automatically guess the data type by the variable's assigned value.


## Why, It's helpful?
Because, When we don't know the actual type of a variable. It will help us to declare a variable without knowing now. 

After assigning a variable's value it will inference. 



## How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?


Typescript is a static typed language.
When we need to declare a variable we have to explicitly define type.

It helps to improve code quality and project maintainability.
